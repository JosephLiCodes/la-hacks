# ECOSCAN

## Inspiration
One of our team members is currently enrolled in a labor studies course and was surprised to learn how exploitative many major corporations can be. Further investigation revealed that numerous companies not only exploit labor but also bend environmental laws to their advantage. Motivated to address this issue, we created EcoScan, an app that helps users find environmentally friendly and ethical products.

## What it does
EcoScan allows users to scan a product's barcode using their device's camera. The app then gathers information about the product and its brand, displaying an EcoScore, the item’s carbon footprint, and a custom ethics score. It also provides insights into the brand's environmental and ethical practices, helping users make informed purchasing decisions based on the company’s actions.

## What's next for EcoScan
We believe that EcoScan has a large potential, and could be used by users all across the world. In the future, we plan to implement dynamic recommendations for more sustainable and ethical products based on what the user scanned, in order to alert them of more sustainable choices.
Additionally, this technology is applicable in wide variety of forms, such as a shopping companion extension that tells you how good or bad the products on the website you're currently shopping on are. We know that there are a lot of people out there who care about ethics and the environment, and we think that EcoScan could be a valuable tool in every shopper's toolbox to make sure that we are only giving our money to the best companies.
